# Python - Async

## Introduction
In this project, I’ll master asynchronous programming in Python with asyncio. I’ll write and manage coroutines, execute tasks concurrently, and measure performance, all while following strict coding guidelines.

### Learning Objectives
 - async and await syntax
 - How to execute an async program with asyncio
 - How to run concurrent coroutines
 - How to create asyncio tasks
 - How to use the random module

### Practical Tasks
**Task 0:** The basics of async - Write an asynchronous coroutine that takes in an integer argument that waits for a random delay in seconds and eventually returns it.

**Task 1:** Multiple coroutines at the same time - write an async routine that takes in 2 int arguments. You will spawn wait_random n times with the specified max_delay.

**Task 2:** Measure the runtime - Create a function that measures the time to execute the remaining functions, it should return a float.

**Task 3:** Tasks - Write a function task_wait_random that takes an integer max_delay and returns a asyncio.Task.

**Task 4:** Tasks - Take the code from wait_n and alter it into a new function task_wait_n. The code is nearly identical to wait_n except task_wait_random is being called.
