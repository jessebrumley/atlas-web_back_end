# Python - Variable Annotations

## Introduction

The "Python - Variable Annotations" project focuses on using type annotations in Python 3 to specify function signatures and variable types, employing concepts such as duck typing and type validation with 'mypy'. By the end of this project, participants will gain an understanding of type annotations and how to effectively validate their Python code to ensure accuracy and readability.

### Learning Objectives

 - Type annotations in Python 3
 - How you can use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
 - Duck typing
 - How to validate your code with mypy

### Practical Tasks
**Task 0:** Basic annotations - add - Write a type-annotated function add that takes a float a and a float b as arguments and returns their sum as a float.

**Task 1:** Basic annotations - concat - Write a type-annotated function concat that takes a string str1 and a string str2 as arguments and returns a concatenated string.

**Task 2:** Basic annotations - floor - Write a type-annotated function floor which takes a float n as an argument and returns the floor of the float.

**Task 3:** Basic annotations - to string - Write a type-annotated function to_str that takes a float n as an argument and returns the string representation of the float.

**Task 4:** Define variables - Define and annotate the following variables: a (an integer with a value of 1), pi (a float with a value of 3.14), i_understand_annotations (a boolean with a value of True), and school (a string with a value of "Holberton").

**Task 5:** Complex types - list of floats - Write a type-annotated function sum_list that takes a list input_list of floats as an argument and returns their sum as a float.

**Task 6:** Complex types - mixed list - Write a type-annotated function sum_mixed_list that takes a list mxd_lst of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.

**Task 7:** Complex types - string and int/float to tuple - Write a type-annotated function to_kv that takes a string k and an int or float v as arguments and returns a tuple. The first element is the string k, and the second element is the square of the int/float v as a float.

**Task 8:** Complex types - functions - Write a type-annotated function make_multiplier that takes a float multiplier as an argument and returns a function that multiplies a float by the multiplier.

**Task 9:** Let's duck type an iterable object - Annotate the function element_length to take a parameter lst of type Iterable[Sequence] and return a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of an element from lst and its length.
