# NoSQL Project
This project focuses on building a basic HTTP API to interact with a MongoDB NoSQL database. It demonstrates key NoSQL operations like querying, inserting, updating, and deleting documents. The project highlights the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases, the benefits of document storage, and how MongoDB handles data.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- List and manage MongoDB databases.
- Insert and query documents from MongoDB collections.
- Update and delete records in a MongoDB database.
- Write Python functions that interface with MongoDB.

### Practical Tasks

**Task 0:** List all databases
* Create a script that lists all databases in MongoDB.
* File: 0-list_databases

**Task 1:** Use or create database
* Write a script that creates or switches to the database my_db.
* File: 1-use_or_create_database

**Task 2:** Insert document
* Write a script to insert a document into the school collection.
* The document must have one attribute: name with the value "Holberton school".
* File: 2-insert

**Task 3:** All documents
* Write a script that lists all documents in the school collection.
* File: 3-all

**Task 4:** All matches
* Write a script that lists all documents with name="Holberton school" in the school collection.
* File: 4-match

**Task 5:** Count documents
* Write a script that displays the number of documents in the school collection.
* File: 5-count

**Task 6:** Update document
* Write a script that adds a new attribute address with the value "972 Mission street" to documents with name="Holberton school".
* File: 6-update

**Task 7:** Delete by match
* Write a script that deletes all documents with name="Holberton school" in the school collection.
* File: 7-delete

**Task 8:** List all documents in Python
* Write a Python function that lists all documents in a collection.
* File: 8-all.py

**Task 9:** Insert a document in Python
* Write a Python function that inserts a new document into a collection based on keyword arguments.
* File: 9-insert_school.py

**Task 10:** Update topics in a document
* Write a Python function that updates the topics of a school document based on the name.
* File: 10-update_topics.py

**Task 11:** Query by topic
* Write a Python function that returns the list of schools that cover a specific topic.
* File: 11-schools_by_topic.py

**Task 12:** Log stats
* Write a Python script that provides some stats about Nginx logs stored in MongoDB.
* File: 12-log_stats.py
